# AdvertisementModule (A NamelessMC Module)

## What is it?
AdvertisementModule is an advertising module made by me, Badger! It's essentially just a NamelessMC module that will allow you to add advertisements to your site in the form of either widgets, page headers, and/or page footers. The advertisements accept HTML in their advertisement content in which you can place google ads and such. You can also manually set up advertisements yourself. You should have some HTML knowledge if you are installing this module, otherwise you probably won't get very far.

## How do I install it?
